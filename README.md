General Information
•	My project consists for 3 songs: confused, excitement and sadness. It allows children to express themselves on a way that is other than talking or getting frustrated. 
•	Children often have difficulty identifying and expressing their emotions, which can lead to frustration or behavioural issues. My prototype will create a platform where children can explore different emotions by interacting with sounds that correspond to feelings like happiness, sadness, excitement, or calm. 
•	By providing an engaging way to link sounds with moods, this project aims to help children develop emotional literacy.
